Nimbus is a suite of applications and services that allow for file, setting and (eventually) application syncing between computers, user, environments and any other conceivable autonomous system. It is highly configurable, customizable and aims to be both user-friendly and powerful, with well-designed GUIs as well as simple and intuitive configuration files.

The Nimbus system for windows includes a windows service that performs file monitoring and event handling, server syncronization and just about all other background tasks; a configuration client to allow users to configure the server without changing the config file directly, as well as send necessary signals to the service; an initialization wizard that generates and encrypts the necessary files and keys to communicate with the central server and finally; a server, this is the central hub of disribution, and can be installed on a local machine, or on a external, internet server providing the service.
